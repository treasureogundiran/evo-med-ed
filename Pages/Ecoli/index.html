            Bacteria are excellent model organisms for studying evolution. They
            are easy to grow, maintain, and handle under very controlled
            conditions. Even more importantly for evolution research, they can
            grow to very large population sizes in small culture flasks, and
            reproduce very rapidly. These characteristics mean that experimental
            populations can have a steady supply of variation for natural
            selection to work upon, and these populations can evolve quickly
            enough for evolution to be studied in action. Finally, unlike
            mammals, bacteria can be frozen without being killed, so samples can
            be taken of evolving populations that can be frozen regularly, and
            revived to discover how evolution worked. One of the most studied
            bacteria is E. coli, which is found in the gut of most warm-blooded
            animals.

        In 1988, Dr. Richard Lenski started the Long-Term Evolution Experiment
        (LTEE), when he founded 12 populations of E. coli from a single clone.
        Every day 1% of each population is transferred to a flask containing a
        fresh volume of a nutrient broth containing a small amount of glucose
        for the bacteria to use as food. Each day the populations go through
        about 6.67 generations, and the twelve have each evolved for more than
        60,000 generations over the course of the experiment so far. Samples of
        each population are frozen every 500 generations, meaning that Dr.
        Lenski has a complete frozen fossil record of the evolution of each
        population from which he can revive bacteria at any time to study their
        evolution.

        The nutrient broth also contains a large amount of citrate, which is
        included to help the bacteria take up the iron they need to grow. This
        citrate could be a second food source for the bacteria, but one of the
        defining characteristics of E. coli as a species is its inability to
        grow on citrate when oxygen is present. However, after ~31,000 bacterial
        generations, one of the populations evolved the capacity to do just
        that. The evolution of this trait, called Cit+, is exceptionally rare.
        Indeed, spontaneous evolution of a Cit+ E. coli was reported only once
        in the entire 20th century!
